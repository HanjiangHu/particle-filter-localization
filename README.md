# Particle Filter Indoor Localization
This is a vectorized Python implementation of particle filter for 2D laser indoor localization, as the homework1 of 16833 CMU

## A short demo

## Instruction
The map is under `./data/map/` and robot logs are under `./data/log/`. Click [here](./docs/HW1SLAM.pdf) for detailed instuction.


## Implementation
The highlight is that the vecterization to speed up the PF process and it has potential to be extended to real-time robot systems. Here is the full [report](./docs/hw.pdf).
